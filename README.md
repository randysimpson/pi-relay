# Pi-Relay

This project will open a port `8080` to http traffic for a REST API interface to control
GPIO outputs for items hooked up to Raspberry Pi 3.

## Installation

The binaries can be downloaded by running:

```sh
wget https://github.com/randysimpson/pi-relay/releases/download/v1.0/pi-relay
chmod +x py-relay
```

To run the application:

```sh
./py-relay
```

## Operation

To use the API from the machine that is running the application:

```sh
curl localhost:8080/api/v1/gpio
```

### Logs

The logs are located at `app.log`.

## API

* `/api/v1/gpio` - Get

  Method used to get the GPIO outputs and states.  The `end_date` variable is only present when the state will be changing.  Therefore in the following example gpio with id `1ab2d` will be changing state to false in 5 minutes 30 seconds, and gpio with id `3vb7f` is in false state.

  ###### JSON response example:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "Success",
    "date": "2019-09-27T15:18:13-06:00Z",
    "result": [
      {
        "id": "1ab2d",
        "gpio": 4,
        "state": true,
        "end_date": "2019-09-27T15:23:43-06:00Z"
      },
      {
        "id": "3vb7f",
        "gpio": 17,
        "state": false
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* `/api/v1/gpio` - Post

    Method used to create a GPIO on the device and set the initial state.

    The body can consist of 1 object or it can be an array of objects.

    ###### JSON body example:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "1vv3s",
      "gpio": 17,
      "state": false
    }
    ```

    ###### JSON response example:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "Created",
      "date": "2019-09-27T15:18:13-06:00Z",
      "result": {
        "id": "1vv3s",
        "gpio": 17,
        "state": false
      }
    }
    ```

* `/api/v1/gpio/{id}` - Get

    Method used to return details on a specific GPIO on the device.  The `end_date` variable is only present when the state will be changing.

    ###### JSON response example:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "Success",
      "date": "2019-09-27T15:18:13-06:00Z",
      "result": {
        "id": "1ab2d",
        "gpio": 4,
        "state": true,
        "end_date": "2019-09-27T15:23:43-06:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```

* `/api/v1/gpio/{id}` - Put

  Method used to modify the GPIO or to turn on/off a GPIO output on the device.
  The optional duration object can be in `minutes`/`seconds`/`milliseconds`/ or
  `end_date`.  If the duration object is omitted then the gpio will remain in the state until another put method is called to change it.

  > The GPIO location cannot be modified through this put method, it will only allow for changing state.

  ###### JSON body example:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "1ab2d",
    "gpio": 4,
    "state": true,
    "duration": {
      "minutes": 5,
      "seconds": 30
    }
  }
  ```

  ###### JSON response example:

  ```json
  {
    "status": "Updated",
    "date": "2019-09-27T15:18:13-06:00Z",
    "result": {
      "id": "1ab2d",
      "gpio": 4,
      "state": true,
      "end_date": "2019-09-27T15:23:43-06:00Z"
    }
  }
  ```

* `/api/v1/gpio/{id}` - Delete

    Method used to delete GPIO on the device.

    ###### JSON response example:

    ```json
    {
      "status": "Deleted",
      "date": "2019-09-27T15:18:13-06:00Z",
      "result": {
        "id": "1ab2d",
        "gpio": 4,
        "state": true
      }
    }
    ```

* `/api/v1/state` - Put

  Method used to modify the GPIO or to turn on/off a GPIO output on the device.
  The optional duration object can be in `minutes`/`seconds`/`milliseconds`/ or
  `end_date`.  If the duration object is omitted then the gpio will remain in the state until another put method is called to change it.

  > The GPIO location cannot be modified through this put method, it will only allow for changing state.
